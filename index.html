  <h1>Privacy Policy for Guldasta e Najat</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 26, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Guldasta e Najat ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect the following information from users:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Phone number</li>
    <li>Location data (only while the app is running in the foreground)</li>
    <li>Device and usage data (e.g., crash logs, device model, OS version)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.1 Prominent Disclosure for Location Access</h3>
  <p>
    Guldasta e Najat requires access to your device's location to provide accurate Islamic prayer (Azan) times based on your geographical position.
    Location data is collected only when the app is actively used and is not stored or shared with any third-party services without your consent.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will be prompted to allow or deny this permission at runtime and can manage this permission anytime from your device settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    A prominent in-app disclosure is shown before any personal or sensitive user data is collected. This disclosure explains what data is collected, how it is used, and includes options for the user to accept or decline. Data collection begins only after the user explicitly provides consent.
  </p>

  <h3>1.2 Prominent Disclosure Example</h3>
  <p>
    Before collecting any location data, Guldasta e Najat will display a clear prompt inside the app that states:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    "Guldasta e Najat requests your location permission to provide accurate Azan and prayer times based on your current position. Your location data will only be used while the app is in use and will not be shared without your consent."
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    You will have the choice to Allow or Deny this permission. Data collection starts only after you give explicit consent.
  </p>
  <p>You can also manage or revoke location permissions anytime from your device settings.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Calculate accurate Azan/prayer times based on location</li>
    <li>Improve and maintain app functionality</li>
    <li>Communicate with users (if needed)</li>
    <li>Monitor app performance and troubleshoot issues</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We may use third-party services that collect and process data, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Firebase (Analytics, Crashlytics)</li>
    <li>Google Sign-In</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services are governed by their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties, except when required to operate core app services or comply with legal obligations.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain user data only for as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or as required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable steps to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. We strive to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Consent</h2>
  <p>
    By using our app, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and grant permission for location access when prompted.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may withdraw your consent at any time by disabling permissions in your device settings or by uninstalling the app.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
